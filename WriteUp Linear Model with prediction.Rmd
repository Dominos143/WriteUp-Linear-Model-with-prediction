knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

require(tidyverse)

## Model 1 SIMS~ARM
### Scattered Plot


```{r}
basicCN <- ggplot(data,aes(x=SIMS,y=ARM))

```

```{r}
basicCN + geom_point()+ ggtitle("SIMS vs ARM")

```


This scatter plot reflects a positive correlation since some of the dots are showing a behavior of going up diagonally.
